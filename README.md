### Some notes on how it works
* Video losing focus, means the default behavior of Space Bar is activated, that is scrolling down
* Video loses focus in these situations
  * When the video is finished playing
  * When the video is auto-paused by scrolling down
  * When the video is paused by click and this script has been triggerd at least once on that video
